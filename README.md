# JSP-Registation-Login-Example
Simple JSP project for user registration and login.

You will get the database also here so to run this project you jsut have to do 3 things.

1. create your own database and import this db
2. open reg.jsp and change dbusername and db password.
3. open login.jsp and change dbusername and db password.

Cheers.!!
Happy Coding.
